        <summary>Political career</summary>

        <h1>Congress Party</h1>
        Rao started his career with the Youth Congress in Medak.[6] He stood by Indira Gandhi even after her defeat in
        the 1977 Lok Sabha polls.[11]

        <h1>Independent Candidate</h1>
        In the 1983 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections,<mark>Rao contested as an independent candidate in the
            Siddipet Assembly constituency</mark>
        He lost to Ananthula Madan Mohan, a Congress candidate and a person he considered as his "guru", by just 877
        votes.

        <h1>Telugu Desam Party</h1>
        After the contest, in 1983, Rao joined the Telugu Desam Party (TDP).
        <mark> won four Assembly elections from Siddipet</mark>consecutively, from 1985 to 1999.
        From 1987 to 1988, he served as the Minister of Drought & Relief in Chief Minister N. T. Rama Rao's cabinet. In
        1990,
        he was appointed TDP convener for Medak, Nizamabad, and Adilabad districts. In 1996,
        he served as Transport minister in Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu's cabinet.
        <mark>also served as the deputy speaker of the Andhra Pradesh Assembly from 2000 to 2001.</mark>

    <p>
        On 27 April 2001, Rao resigned from the Telugu Desam Party, leaving his position of Deputy Speaker as well.
        He asserted that the people of the Telangana region were being discriminated against and believed that a
        separate state was the only solution. The same day, he formed the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) Party (now
        called the Bharat Rashtra Samithi) at Jala Drushyam, Hyderabad to achieve Telangana statehood. In the
        2004 elections,<mark>he won from Siddipet and also the Karimnagar Lok Sabha constituency by-election</mark>  both as a TRS
        candidate. The TRS fought the 2004 general elections in alliance with the Indian National Congress with a
        Promise of Congress Party to give Telangana State and Rao was one of the five TRS candidates who returned as
        MPs.

        TRS was part of the United Progressive Alliance coalition government, led by Congress. Rao went on to become a
        Union Cabinet minister of Labour and Employment in the UPA government.The party later withdrew from the
        coalition, saying that the Alliance was not minded to support a separate Telangana state. He has
        resigned as MP in 2006 on a challenge of Congress and won with a huge majority of more than 200,000 votes. Again
        he resigned as MP in agitation of Telangana movement and won with a minor majority.
