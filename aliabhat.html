        Bhatt has frequently combated negative attention, including online trolling, for benefiting from nepotism within
        the Hindi film industry. When asked about how she deals with it, she said, "Of course, I felt bad. But feeling
        bad is a small price to pay for the work that you are respected and loved for.<mark>This criticism has extended
            to Johar</mark>  who often praises her publicly and casts her in most of his productions; their critics believe that
        this favouritism comes at the cost of opportunities for other actresses. Johar defended his admiration of Bhatt
        by saying that he feels parental towards her.
